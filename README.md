üìù Project Summary
This project is an innovative fusion of IoT, AI, and embedded systems, designed to automate the process of detecting plant diseases and applying fertilizers precisely. It addresses the limitations of manual crop monitoring and fertilizer application by using real-time disease detection and targeted spraying, making agriculture smarter and more sustainable.

üîç Problem Statement
Traditional farming relies heavily on manual inspection of crops for diseases and blanket fertilizer application, leading to:

Delay in disease detection

Excessive fertilizer usage

Increased labor cost

Lower crop yield

üí° Objective
To build an AI-enabled IoT system that:

Detects plant diseases using real-time image classification.

Automatically sprays fertilizer precisely at the diseased plant.

Minimizes fertilizer usage and human labor.

Operates in both manual and automatic modes for versatility.

üß† Proposed Solution
A smart robotic system that uses an ESP32-CAM module to scan plants for disease using a trained machine learning model. When a disease is detected, the ESP32-CAM sends coordinates to the main ESP32 board via Wi-Fi. The main board then activates a CoreXY mechanism to move a spray nozzle to the target location, triggers a fertilizer pump, and alerts with a buzzer. The system further integrates Blynk Cloud for remote monitoring, control, and real-time alerts, providing a comprehensive solution for precision agriculture. The system resets and continues scanning the next plant.

‚öôÔ∏è Detailed Working Principle (A to Z)
Image Acquisition: An ESP32-CAM module continuously captures live video/images of plant leaves as it moves across rows of plants.

AI-Based Disease Detection: Captured images are analyzed using a lightweight ML model deployed on the ESP32-CAM (trained with Edge Impulse). The model identifies whether a plant is healthy or diseased based on visible symptoms on the leaves.

Coordinate Communication: Once a disease is detected, the ESP32-CAM transmits data via Wi-Fi to a main ESP32 controller. The data includes the detection result and the relative coordinates of the diseased plant.

CoreXY Movement Control: The main ESP32 controls a CoreXY mechanism using stepper motors and drivers to precisely move a fertilizer-spraying nozzle to the diseased plant's location.

Fertilizer Spraying: A relay-activated pump sprays fertilizer precisely onto the detected plant using a nozzle controlled by the CoreXY system.

Siren Alert: A buzzer siren is triggered the moment disease is detected. It remains active until the spraying process is completed, then it automatically stops.

Moisture Monitoring (Optional Extension): A soil moisture sensor can also be integrated to monitor watering needs alongside fertilizer spraying.

Remote Monitoring with Blynk Cloud: All important parameters and events (like disease detected, pump on/off, coordinates of diseased plants, system status) are updated to the Blynk Cloud via the main ESP32 board.

Blynk Mobile Dashboard: Users can access the Blynk mobile app to monitor system operations in real time. The dashboard displays sensor data, disease detection alerts, current coordinates, pump status, and system mode (manual/automatic). Users can also switch modes and trigger actions remotely.

Power and Connectivity: The system operates using a 5V‚Äì12V power source. Wi-Fi connectivity is essential for communication between ESP32-CAM and the main ESP32, and for syncing with the Blynk Cloud.

Manual and Auto Modes: The system supports both:

Auto Mode: ESP32-CAM scans and triggers spraying autonomously.

Manual Mode: Using Blynk or a joystick, users can manually control the movement and spraying.

Application Scope:

Home gardening

Greenhouses

Vertical farms

Educational agriculture research

Precision farming test beds
